### Nav Bars, Home Pages, and CSS

Peter Griffin CSS gif

I think we've all seen this gif by now (obviously I just showed it to you (or told you what it looked like)). Thats how I feel wioth the home page and NavBar right now. On mobile, the padding and or margins of the brand mean nothing. ir just starts at the top od the page and doesn't seem to care what I say. yet, it's still doing alright on desktop. But I'm trying to build this page with a mobile first mentality. I want the mobile view to look right, then I can worry about desktop. But the page will not cooperate.
