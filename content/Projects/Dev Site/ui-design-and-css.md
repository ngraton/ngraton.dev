Have been working extensively on the layout and design of the site. Changing aspects of the UI/UX as well. 

Have the project logs and tags in a sidebar. I think the project pages are looking pretty good, although the tag buttons could still use a little work.

The nav bar needs some responsive love. But I need to find a way to space it out that doesn't mess with the dropdown that happens for mobile. Adding the non-brand links to their own `div`  and using `justify-content: space-between`was messing that up. I think I have an idea for how to do it, we'll have to see if it works.

The main page could use some adjustment — i'll have to make a call on whether I want the links in a sidebar or below the welcome. The sidebar doesn't make much sense — the welcome blurb will be short, so most of the page would be sidebar. I could put the blurb in the sidebar — that's an option. I'll have to play around with it to see what makes the most sense. 

Mobile is doing ok — I need to put in an icon for the dropdown, and figure out the tagline font size and placement, but beyond that I'm pretty happy with it.

I started this color scheme as a bit of a joke — I thought it might wind up as an easter egg option or something and was just using it as a filler — but, it turns out I actually like it.  Still need a bit more work on the font selections — they're close, but not quite right.
