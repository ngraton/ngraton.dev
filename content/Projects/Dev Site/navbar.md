Working on the NavBar. Trying to build a brand with a particular font. I have discovered that this font has space at the bottom so that it doesn't look centered vertically in the NavBar. Carefully placed it with padding so that it looks vertically centered.
Added an icon, had to play with the spacing for that too.
Added fonts. Imported them into the css with `@import` statements.
I will probably customize the brand in illustrator, turn it into one big SVG.
Even though its not the prettiest, I'm done messing with the NavBar for now. I want it to match the styling of the rest of the pages, obviously. Therefore, I'm going to get the skeleton of the rest of the pages up, so I can start working on the overall styling of everything at once and know how it all looks together.
