Built a new template for posts with a category of `"project"` and then edited `gatsby-node.js` to make that the component used to build pages in that category. Added the title to the context for projects and used that to build the list of project logs into the bottom of project pages. Still a lot of UX and styling to be done. And the placement of different pieces will probably change, but the framework is built.
