### Nav Bars, Home Pages, and CSS
![Peter Griffin trying to level blinds captioned CSS][image-1]

I think we've all seen this gif by now (obviously I just showed it to you.) Thats how I feel with the home page and NavBar right now. On mobile, the padding and or margins of the brand mean nothing. It just starts at the top of the page and doesn't seem to care what I say. Yet, it's still doing alright on desktop. But I'm trying to build this page with a mobile first mentality. I want the mobile view to look right, then I can worry about desktop. But the page will not cooperate.
