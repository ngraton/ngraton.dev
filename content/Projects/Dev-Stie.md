## What is It?
The very site you are looking at. My own personal piece of interweb real estate, built by me to be as close to my ideal as possible.

## What's it use?
Gatsby, (and therefore React and GraphQL), and CSS. (no SASS or UI frameworks). 

## What did I/do I hope to learn in building it?
- GraphQL is powerful stuff.
- Learning a lot about static site generation.
- Expanding my knowledge of React and JavaScript.
- Hopefully, building some basic design knowledge.
